The necessary parties are those minimum necessary parties to fulfill all authorization components. All necessary parties to authorize this requisition must complete the one relevant section, unless one party fulfills the necessary authorization component or components of more than one section, in which case that party may instead complete the first or most relevant section and sign the signature ("SIGN") fields of each additional section. All necessary parties must stamp this document below to complete authorization.
** If no Deck Chief or Deck Officer authorizes this form, this section must instead be completed by the XO, CO or ROIC of the ONSITE ASSET.
*** The line officer, CXPL, or CPO in command of the requesting party is required to authorize requisitions to which the requesting party is not intended usual access. If such an individual is making this request on behalf of another party, this section is not required.
**** The requisition of secured, controlled or restricted items must be authorized by a party authorized to possess or operate such items. The ratings of Senior Engineer, Brig Officer, Chief Medical Officer, Deck Chief, and Pathfinder, or any member of the chain of command in place above one or more such rating, may authorize secured, controlled or restricted items relevant to their positions. If no item or items requested are secured, controlled or restricted, then this section may be left blank. If multiple items are requested whose relevant controlling authorities differ, an officer in the chain of command above both authorities must instead authorize this requisition, those items must be requested in multiple forms UF102b, or the requisition must be made using forms UF102c or UF602b.[/i][/small]
